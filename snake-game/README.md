# Snake game - Scrimba project (legally distinct worm game)
## Module 4 - CSS & Javascript fundamentals

### Added features

#### CSS
* Flat UI dark theme styling
* Flex box and flex grid layouts
* Somewhat responsive, at least for desktop screens
* Added new states to segments of the "worm"

#### Javascript
* Since the worm is more visually complex, had to add logic to rotate parts of the worm as the player changes direction
* Refactored a lot of the code into reusable functions and variables
* Added 3 difficulty options with varying grid size, initial speed, and speed increase multiplier
